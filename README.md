# cf-bypassing

This is just a small project on ways of bypassing Cloudflare browser-checking and blocking IPs, and other services from other companies.


# Why?

I'm making this to show the weaknesses with Cloudflare which can be used to improve your own website and prevent attackers, and to help others able to use utils like wget on websites behind Cloudflare that block their requests.


# Quick info

The intent of this tiny project isn't to help people with malicious purposes, only to help people further protect their site with the current weaknesses in Cloudflare and similar services and hopefully for others to contribute to current & hypothetical methods of bypassing such services to again help people in protecting themselves and the ability to bypass the services to help save time getting large quantities of items using utils like wget.
